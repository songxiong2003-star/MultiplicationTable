Throughout most of my web design projects, I feel this one made me feel stuck the most. It had more complex ways to do things and many ways to implement the codes. It was interesting to learn
how to create buttons and being able to make them function. But one thing that confused me the most was getting the pages mixed up at times and having to know where to plance the codes in their right files. Another difficult task of this project was also trying to follow along and understand at the same time. But if I miss one word or code, my webside or generator would not work.
