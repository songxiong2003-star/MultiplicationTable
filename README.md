Throughout most of my web design projects, I feel this one made me stuck the most. It had more complex ways to do things and many ways to implement the codes. It was interesting to learn
How to creat buttons and being able to make them function. But one thing that confused me the most was getting the pages mixed up and knowing where to plance the codes in their right files. 
Another difficult task of this project was also trying to follow along but understand at the same time and if I miss one word or code my webside or generator would not work. Althought there
were some difficulties my favorite part was when my code worked on the website.
